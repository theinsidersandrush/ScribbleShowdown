- Recreation of "Scribble Showdown - After Dark"'s website. 
  - An event occuring in The Theatre at Ace Hotel, at Los Angeles, California, United States of America.
  This event is only intended for audiences that are 18 years or older.

- Description from the website:


  Scribble Showdown’s older brother who just got out of jail.

  Come see five of YouTube’s biggest animators compete in an improvisational animation game show.

  Arin Hanson (Egoraptor) and the audience will put TheOdd1sOut, JaidenAnimations, RubberRoss, and Domics through a series of brand new competitive drawing games… the  kind of games that can’t be in an All Ages show.

  So bring your IDs (18+) and get ready to hear the F word!
  
  That's it.
  
  __This event is complete.__
