Welcome to Scribble After Dark

"Scribble Showdown’s older brother who just got out of jail.

Come see five of YouTube’s biggest animators compete in an improvisational animation game show.

Arin Hanson (Egoraptor) and the audience will put TheOdd1sOut, JaidenAnimations, RubberRoss, and Domics through a series of brand new competitive drawing games… the kind of games that can’t be in an All Ages show.

So bring your IDs (for legal purposes ofc (18+)) and get ready to hear the F word!"
